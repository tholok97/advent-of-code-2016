**NOTE**: *I have solved all the tasks, but am in the process of getting them up to the standard of my [Advent of Code 2017 solution](https://github.com/tholok97/advent-of-code-2017). Building and running might sometimes be a pain, and some tasks lack comments.*

## How to build

An empty `make` command will build all the days in sequence.

## How to run

`make` followed by dayX will (build and) run the executable for day X. For example: `make day4` will run day 4. The argument you're passing to make must be a filename to a .cpp file in the repository without it's extension. `make day11_old` will run the executable for `day11_old.cpp`. Alternatively you can run the executables directly from the `bin` directory (after building with make).

## Status

**Note:** All the days have been solved, but the repo is being renovated. The status indicates whether the day is finalized.
